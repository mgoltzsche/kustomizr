# This configures the semantic-release tool, see https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release
# (installation: `npm install -g semantic-release @semantic-release/exec`, run: `npx semantic-release`).
# The tool creates a new release if the branch contains e.g. BREAKING CHANGE|feat|fix commits since the last release, following the Angular Commit Message Conventions.
# Commits that don't match the message convention or don't introduce user-facing changes will not trigger the creation of a new release.
